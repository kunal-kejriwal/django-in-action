# django-in-action
A structured, reference-oriented Django repository covering core Django concepts, API patterns, and backend best practices, with room for full-fledged projects.

# Django In Action

This repository provides a structured collection of Django examples
focused on backend development, API design, and production-ready patterns.

The repository is organized into:
- Concept-based examples (Django fundamentals and APIs)
- Standalone projects demonstrating real-world use cases

This is intended as a reference for backend developers rather than
a step-by-step tutorial.

## Topics Covered
- Django project and app structure
- URL routing and views
- Models and relationships
- Django REST Framework basics
- Middleware and request lifecycle
- Authentication and permissions

## Projects
The `projects/` directory contains complete Django applications
that demonstrate real-world backend use cases.

## Who This Is For
- Backend developers
- Engineers familiar with FastAPI or Spring Boot
- Developers looking to understand Django’s architecture
